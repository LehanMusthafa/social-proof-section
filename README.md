## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Media queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By doing this project, I've learned a lot about css flexbox. It was very handy. I could also use css-grid, but I chose flexbox. I believe that you can learn a lot more about css-grid and flexbox by doing this project.

### Continued development

By this time I've learned a lot about css flexbox. But I'm not so practised with css-grid method, so I would be focusing on that in the coming projects.

### Useful resources

- [social_proof_Web](https://github.com/krysnkem/Christian-social-proof-section-master) - This project helped me very much in adding the css properties.
