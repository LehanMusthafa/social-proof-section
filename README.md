## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Media queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By doing this project, I've learned a lot about css flexbox. It was very handy. I could also use css-grid, but I chose flexbox. I believe that you can learn a lot more about css-grid and flexbox by doing this project.

### Continued development

By this time I've learned a lot about css flexbox. But I'm not so practised with css-grid method, so I would be focusing on that in the coming projects.

### Useful resources

- [social_proof_Web](https://github.com/krysnkem/Christian-social-proof-section-master) - This project helped me very much in adding the css properties.
